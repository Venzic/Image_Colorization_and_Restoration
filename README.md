# Image_Colorization_and_Restoration
Developed an AI-powered image colorization and restoration system using DeOldify, leveraging GANs and deep learning for realistic results. Fine-tuned pre-trained models for accuracy, built a Python-based interface for easy image processing, and optimized performance with PyTorch and fastai to enhance image quality while reducing artifacts.
